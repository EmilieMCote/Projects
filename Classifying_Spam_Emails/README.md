In Part 1:
- we use Logistic Regression to build a simple model using words as features
- Calculate Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and False Positive Rate
- Compare our simple model to a zero-predictor

In Part 2:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Perform Feature Engineering
- Create a classifier with more features
- use the best_estimator from GridSearchCV
- Build ROC Curve
- Analyze Model Complexity vs Interpretability
